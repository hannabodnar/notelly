# Notelly

Notelly is a journal web application that was created using Django with Python and HTML scripts. A user authentication system was implemented with a decorator to provide restricted access and keep user data safe. The application was styled using Bootstrap and deployed using the Heroku CLI. Each registered user can add topics and create or edit entries for each topic. 

This is an on-going project and new features may be added.
